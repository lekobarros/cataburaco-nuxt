# cataburaco-nuxt

This application was made for a college project to build a sample Progressive Web App with the most currency front-end technologies.

The Application "Cata Buraco" consists of the user reporting the street holes find around on localization for the local government can easily locate the street holes and adjust them for the population.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server

$ npm run generate
```

## Front-end Technologies

For building the application I choose Nuxt.js/Vue.js as a base in the main framework with Bootstrap for the project UI.

The core of the project run with [ArcGIS MapView](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html) and another API ES6+ to get the current localization.

- Vue.js/Nuxt.js, Vuex and Vue Router;
- Bootstrap for UI
- Vue libs: vuelidate, vue-notification
- General libs: DayJs, lodash, ngrok

## Features
- Add a street hole based on your localization.
- View the reported street holes around on current localization with a list or map view.
